**Self-build software from source**  
**Native Installation**  

Install [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/ "Termux with F-Droid, GP Termux is no longer updated!")  
```
# NOTE_1!: Installing Snoop on Termux is time consuming (minutes).
# NOTE_2!: if the user has errors with $ 'pkg update', for example due to country censorship,
# and/or due to the fact that Termux has not been updated for a long time on the user's device,
# then removing/installing Termux application will not help,
# since after deletion, old repositories remain on the user's device, the solution is:
$ termux-change-repo
# and choose to get updates (for all repo) from another mirror repository.

# Enter Termux home folder (i.e. just open Termux)
$ termux-setup-storage
$ pwd #/data/data/com.termux/files/home # default/home directory

# Install python3 and dependencies
$ apt update && pkg upgrade && pkg install python libcrypt libxml2 libxslt git
$ pip install --upgrade pip

# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/snooppr/snoop -b snoop_termux
# (if the flash drive is FAT (not ext4), in this case,
# clone the repository only to the Termux HOME directory)

# Enter the Snoop working directory
$ cd ~/snoop
# Install the 'requirements' dependencies
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# To expand the terminal output in Termux (by default, 2k lines are displayed in the CLI),  
for example, displaying the entire database of the option '--list-all [1/2]'  
add the line 'terminal-transcript-rows=10000' to the file '~/.termux/termux.properties'  
(the feature is available in Termux v0.114+).  
Restart Termux. 

# The user can also launch the Snoop Project on the snoop command from anywhere in the cli by creating an alias.  
$ printf "alias snoop='cd && cd snoop && python snoop.py'" >> .bashrc  
# The user can also run a quick check on the database of the site he is interested in, without using the 'list-all' option, using the 'snoopcheck'command
$ alias snoopcheck='cd && cd snoop && printf 2 | python snoop.py --list-all | grep -i' >> .bashrc  
# restart Termux.

  --normal-mode, -N     Mode switch: SNOOPninja> normal mode> SNOOPninja. 
                        By_default (GNU/Linux Full Version) on 
                        'SNOOPninja mode': search acceleration ~ 25pct,
                        RAM saving ~ 50pct, repeated 'flexible' connection on
                        failed resources. SNOOPninja mode is only effective for
                        Snoop for GNU/Linux Full Version. The default
                        (on Windows) is 'normal mode'. 
                        In Demo Version, the mode switch is deactivated
  --quick-mode , -q     Quiet search mode on. Intermediate
                        the results are not printed. Repeated flexible
                        connections on faulty resources without slowing down
                        the software. The most advanced search mode 
                        (in development - not use)
```

**Example**
```
# To search for just one user:
$ python3 snoop.py username1
# Or, for example, Cyrillic is supported:
$ python3 snoop.py олеся
# To search for a name containing a space:
$ python3 snoop.py "bob dylan"
$ python3 snoop.py bob_dylan
$ python3 snoop.py bob-dylan

# To search for one or more users:
$ python3 snoop.py username1 username2 username3 username4

# Search for multiple users - sorting the output of results by country;
# avoid long freezes on sites (more often the 'dead zone' depends on your ip-address);
# print only found accounts; save pages found
# of accounts locally; specify a file with a list of wanted accounts;
# connect to search for Snoop's extensible and updatable web-base:
$ python3 snoop.py -с -t 9 -f -S -u ~/file.txt -w

# 'ctrl-c' — abort search
```
Found accounts will be stored in '~/snoop/results/nicknames/*/username. {Txt.csv.html}'.  
To access the browser to search results on the Android platform, it is desirable to have root rights.  
csv open in *office, field separator **comma**.    

Destroy **all** search results - delete the directory '~/snoop/results'.
or ```python snoop.py --autoclean```

```
# Update Snoop to test new software features:
$ python3 snoop.py --update y #requires a Git installation.
```
